# 💡 **Problem Statement**

- The current challenge lies in motivating individuals to actively engage in sustainability efforts and support NGOs. Many are unaware of their potential impact and lack incentives. We aim to address this problem by incentivizing and rewarding eco-conscious actions through our Badge-backed platform
